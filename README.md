This is a Power BI project on the sales and demography analysis of **360Interiors**, an interior company. The project's goal is to analyze and derive insights to answer crucial questions and help the company make data-driven decisions. 

Power BI Concepts Applied:

-	DAX Concepts: Calculated columns, custom columns, Year (), IF ()
-	Data Modeling: Star Schema (*:1)
  
**_Disclaimer_**: _All datasets and reports do not represent any company, institution, or country, but just a dummy dataset to demonstrate my capabilities of using Power BI._ 

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:

- Data cleaning and inspection
- Handling missing values
- Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA involves exploring the sales data to answer key questions such as;
1.	Which state has the highest impact on income in the current year?
2.	Who are the top 5 active and profitable customers?
3.	What is the profit/loss trend from January to December?
4.	What are the KPIs for Total Sales, Profit, and Profit Margin?

## Skills/Concepts Demonstrated
